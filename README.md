# Bells-Palsy-Project
Android app for bell's palsy patients

This project is our final project as part of our BSc degree in software engineering at SCE college of engineering, Israel. 
We also work as part of TOM association.

The main idea of this app is to keep track of physiotherapy process of bell's palsy patients.
One of the main goals is to create mathematical measures to define the progress of the patient.
Those measure created with Yael Veierov.

The core of image processing in this project is "dlib" library. 
We based on tzutalin's project that adjusted the library to run on android.
